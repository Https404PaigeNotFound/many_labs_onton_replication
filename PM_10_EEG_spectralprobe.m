Spectral Response to Probe Letters
Spectral Analysis
Action: Analyse spectral responses during memory maintenance and after Probe letter onsets.
Purpose: To examine changes in theta power related to memory load and probe response.
Figures: Fig. 8A shows smoothed trial-by-trial time courses of log power at 6 Hz before and after Probe presentation. Fig. 8B shows smoothed trial-by-trial time courses of log power at 3 Hz after Probe presentation.
Results Section: Spectral response to probe letters.
