Co-Modulation of Component Activities
Correlation Analysis
Action: Compute correlations of single-trial theta ERSP template weights between component pairs.
Purpose: To analyse co-modulation of theta activity across components.
Figures: Fig. 5B shows co-modulation of theta power between component pairs.
Results Section: Component phase coherence and co-modulation.
